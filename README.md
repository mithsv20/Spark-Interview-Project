## 1. Spark Fundamentals
- **Spark Architecture**: Understand the core components of Spark: Driver, Executor, Cluster Manager.
- **Data Abstractions**: Study the differences between RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets.
- **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**: Learn how Spark's DAG works and its importance in job execution.
- **Spark Web UI**: Explore the Spark Web UI to monitor jobs, stages, and tasks.

**Example Questions:**
- What are the differences between RDD, DataFrame, and Dataset in Spark?
- How does the Spark DAG work, and how is it different from MapReduce?

## 2. Data Ingestion
- **Reading Data**: Practice reading data from CSV, JSON, Parquet, and other formats.
- **Schema Management**: Learn how to define, infer, and evolve schemas.
- **Data Validation**: Implement validation logic and handle corrupt data.

**Example Questions:**
- How do you read a CSV file from HDFS into a DataFrame with a predefined schema?
- How do you handle malformed records when reading JSON data in Spark?
- how to enable sparkUI in glue job ?


## 3. Data Organization
- **Partitioning Strategies**: Optimize read and write operations with efficient partitioning.
- **Caching and Persistence**: Understand when to cache data for performance gains.
- **Data Layout Optimization**: Use techniques like bucketing and partition pruning.

**Example Questions:**
- What are the best practices for partitioning large datasets in Spark?
- How does caching affect the performance of a Spark job?

## 4. Data Processing for KPI Calculation
- **Transformations and Actions**: Use transformations (map, filter, join) and actions (collect, count) effectively.
- **Aggregation**: Calculate KPIs using `agg()`, `groupBy()`, and window functions.
- **Large-Scale Data Processing**: Strategies for handling large datasets.

**Example Questions:**
- How would you calculate the average revenue per customer using a DataFrame?
- Explain how to optimize join operations in Spark for large datasets.

## 5. Pipeline Creation
- **ETL Pipeline Design**: Build end-to-end ETL pipelines for data ingestion, processing, and output.
- **Orchestration**: Familiarize yourself with orchestration tools like Apache Airflow.
- **Streaming Data**: Understand Spark Streaming and Structured Streaming for real-time processing.

**Example Questions:**
- How would you design a data pipeline to process daily sales data?
- What is the difference between batch processing and stream processing in Spark?

## 6. Testing, Clean Code, and Debugging
- **Unit Testing**: Write tests for Spark code using `pytest` or `unittest`.
- **Code Refactoring**: Follow clean code practices and modularize code.
- **Error Handling**: Implement exception handling in Spark jobs.

**Example Questions:**
- How do you write unit tests for a Spark DataFrame transformation?
- What techniques do you use to handle errors in a Spark application?

## 7. Programming Concepts (OOP and Functional Programming)
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Use classes, inheritance, encapsulation in Spark.
- **Functional Programming**: Practice using higher-order functions and immutability.
- **Functional Approach in Spark**: Apply the functional programming paradigm in Spark transformations.

**Example Questions:**
- How does Spark's functional programming model improve performance?
- Provide an example of using higher-order functions in Spark.
- What is the difference between groupBy vs reduceByKey in pyspark?

## 8. Performance Optimization
- **Performance Tuning**: Focus on memory management, parallelism, and resource allocation.
- **Shuffle Operations**: Minimize shuffle operations for better performance.
- **Broadcast Variables**: Use broadcast variables to optimize joins.

**Example Questions:**
- What techniques would you use to optimize a Spark job that runs slowly?
- How do broadcast variables help improve the performance of Spark applications?
- what are all the cases when for a job DAG option is not available when we go inside that job in sparkUI?


## 9. Extensibility of Code
- **Schema Evolution**: Design data schemas that can evolve without breaking pipelines.
- **API Design**: Build modular and extensible APIs for data processing.

**Example Questions:**
- How would you handle schema evolution in a Spark-based data pipeline?
- What principles do you follow while designing APIs for data processing?

## 10. Mock Coding Practice
- **Coding Challenges**: Practice Spark coding exercises on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank.
- **Code Review**: Review existing Spark codebases for improvements.

**Mock Interview Practice:** Simulate a real-time coding interview with a friend or use online platforms.
